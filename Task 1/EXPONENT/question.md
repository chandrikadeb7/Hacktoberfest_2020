You are G2. Your mathematics teacher has confiscated your phone because he caught you using it during the class. He makes you an offer; he will return your phone if you are able to solve a problem given by him; otherwise not only will he not return your phone, you also would have to sit in detention. He gives you a number. Now he wants you to calculate the exponent of the given number contained in the factorial of another given number.

Input
First line takes integers M and N.
M=Number whose exp. has to be found out
N= Number whose factorial is to be taken
Output
An integer giving the exponent.

Example
Input:
5 10
Output:
2
Explanation
We have to find exp. of 5 in 10!
10! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10
= 52*(1*2*3*4*6*7*8*9*2)
Exp. of 5 in 10! = 2
