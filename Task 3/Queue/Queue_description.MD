A queue is an abstract data type (an abstract data type means a conceptual or mathematical
model which specifies different types of operations on that data type, but does not specify
how these operations will be implemented.Ex-stack,queue.list).

In a queue we can perform the following operations :

1. Enqueue: to add an element at rear end of the queue.
2. Dequeue: to remove an element from the front of the queue.
3. Display: to print the queue content from front to rear.
4. Peek: to print the front element of the queue.

A queue works on FIFO (First In First Out) basis.It means the element which is added at the
last will be removed last out of the queue and the element which is added first will be
removed first.

A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list data structure.

Applications:

1. Processor and Device scheduling.
2. To implement BFS for graph traversal, and many more.
